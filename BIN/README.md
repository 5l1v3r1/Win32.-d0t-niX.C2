# DR-Releases (dev-VER 0.5.1 BETA-2)
The "N0T-iLLerka.XRW" File is the Release-Windows Binary (.exe)\
(This is the Binary from the MSBuild Release-Configuration.)

The "N0T-iLLerka.XDW" File is the Debug-Windows Binary (.exe)\
The "N0T-iLLerka.XDC" File is the Debug-Console Binary (.exe)\
(These are from the MSBuild Debug-Configurations, they likely won't run on your system but I've included them anyways.)

These Files are here so you don't have to go through the trouble to compile them yourself

## Note:
The Version of the precompiled Binary **must not** always be the Version of the current Source Code.\
The Version Number that is standing next to the Maintitle is probably the Version of the Binary.\
(The exact Version Number of the Binary will stand in the commit details anyways)
