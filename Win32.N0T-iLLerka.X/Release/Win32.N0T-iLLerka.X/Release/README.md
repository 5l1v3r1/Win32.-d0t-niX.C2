# R-Release (dev-VER 0.5.1 BETA-2)
The "N0T-iLLerka.XR" File is the Binary (.exe)\
(This is the Binary from The VSBuild Release-Configuration)

This File is here so you don't have to go through the trouble to compile it yourself\
(Because opening the .sln File and pressing CTRL+B is really hard :D)

## Note:

The Version of the precompiled Binary **must not** always be the Version of the current Source Code.\
The Version Number that is standing next to the Maintitle is probably the Version of the Binary.\
(The exact Version Number of the Binary will stand in the commit details anyways)
