A C/C++ (MSVC) recreation off the original Win32.VB.Illerka.C Virus by [Michael [APFX]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDo-73OtSjnMKVIEidGu2Xw) (AppleFanXXX)

Demonstration-Video of the Original:\

## About this Project
I wanted to recreate the Illerka.C Virus but using more efficent C/C++ instead of Visual-Basic (in which the original was coded)\
Aswell as that I want to add more functionality to it.
 
I don't know why Im doing this (don't ask why)\
(Hint: I still don't know why, but it should give newcommers some insights into malware development)

I should also note that this project is a just-for-fun project, it's basically a playground for me to test new stuff I've learned.\
This project is also very similar to two older projects of mine:
- hDir 5: a Malware installer (this never got published on my Github but you can find the source on YouTube though)\
  compared to this project hDir 5 was a piece of garbage (well I've written it about 2 years ago which was when I started learing C/C++)
- COBRA-6: basically Illerka.C's main Payload, but poorly done (this never got published at all and probably for good,
  I don't even know if I still have the original source but Im not even sure if I want to take a second look at it.)

Also this is my first own "big" (atleast to me) project.

## Project Development Progress
- I've upgraded the User-Warning to prevent accidental continuation of execution by requiring the user to create a File with a random generated name that the Malware checks for after the user accepts the Warningmessage.

Further Information will allways be posted/updated accordingly...

## Screenshots:
First successfull launch of the Malware:\

## ToDo-List:
Things listed here are possible Improvements/Changes/Additions that are likely going to be made.\
If marked they're WIP (Work in Progress)

- [x] Improve `fnMessageHandlerW`
- [x] Implement Process -monitor/-iterator
- [x] Implement Registry -monitor/-iterator
- [x] Implement /exec-Watchdog
- [x] Improve Protections (watchdog - add thread that activly monitors programms like `taskmgr.exe`)
- [ ] Start to implement dropper functionality\
  (I've started to play around with DLL's and well it seems like that I'll have to explicitly link them,
  if I want to do it like I've planned/intended it to do it (if I even do it))
- [ ] Add a WindowClass and WindowProc (this will be important for some new functionality I've planned to implement)
- [ ] More persistence (prevent Systemshudowns using the WindowProc and the ShudownAPI)

### Release-List:
Things listed here are from the ToDo-List but implemented in the Source-Code.\
(which doesn't mean that they work properly, they're just implemented and don't have to be tested/debugged yet (kinda similar to WIP but already working, sort of))\
If marked they're fully functional and tested/debugged and ready for Release\
(which also doesn't mean that they can't be improved)

- [x] Improve User-Warning
- [ ] If UAC is required launch with CMD (Stealth)
