# This Project is DEAD
The idea itself was "DOA" and thats for reasons..\
The Malware itself doesn't make any sense, it's simply not what it should have been.


A C/C++ (MSVC) recreation off the original Win32.VB.Illerka.C Virus by [Michael [APFX]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDo-73OtSjnMKVIEidGu2Xw) (AppleFanXXX)

Demonstration-Video of the Original:\

## About this Project
I wanted to recreate the Illerka.C Virus but using more efficent C/C++ instead of Visual-Basic (in which the original was coded)\
Aswell as that I want to add more functionality to it.
 
I don't know why Im doing this (don't ask why)\
(Hint: I still don't know why, but it should give newcommers some insights into malware development)

I should also note that this project is a just-for-fun project, it's basically a playground for me to test new stuff I've learned.\
This project is also very similar to two older projects of mine:
- hDir 5: a Malware installer (this never got published on my Github but you can find the source on YouTube though)\
  compared to this project hDir 5 was a piece of garbage (well I've written it about 2 years ago which was when I started learing C/C++)
- COBRA-6: basically Illerka.C's main Payload, but poorly done (this never got published at all and probably for good,
  I don't even know if I still have the original source but Im not even sure if I want to take a second look at it.)

Also this is my first own "big" (atleast to me) project.

## This Project is under Development
**If you want see/have the newest Source refer to the beta branch, this is where I'll be uploading the current state of the code\
(meaning that this will include unfinished / untested / temporery / buggy or even non working code)**\
